# KeepInventory

An Unturned Plugin that saves the player inventory before they dies and then give back all the items back to the player.
This plugins also cater to drop item by a pre-defined percentage. Note that this is not my plugin, I did not create it. It just an old plugin i found and no longer in the rocketmod harbor.

## How to use

Require the permission: keepinventory.keep

To make the player drop based on percentage, you must put this permission:

* 50% drop: keepinventory.vip
* 20% drop: keepinventory.vvip
* 10% drop: keepinventory.arch

So in the permission file you'll going to have both .keep and .vip

## Side Note

* Note that you need both .keep and .vip/.vvip/.arch if you want them to drop items based on certain percentage. Use .keep ONLY if you want them to save 100% of  their items

* Editted some code for custom use. Sorry that I'm not using the configuration files for adjustable percentage
