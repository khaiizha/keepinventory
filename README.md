# keepinventory

An Unturned Plugin that saves the player inventory before they dies and then give back all the items back to the player.
This plugins also cater to drop item by a pre-defined percentage.

Require the permission: keepinventory.keep

To make the player drop based on percentage, you must put this permission:
50% drop: keepinventory.vip
20% drop: keepinventory.vvip
10% drop: keepinventory.arch

Note that you need both .keep and .vip/.vvip/.arch if you want them to drop items based on certain percentage. Use .keep if you want them
to save all their items

Editted some code for custom use. Sorry if I'm not using the config files for that.
